The world looms huge above them, and they realize with dawning horror—they've been turned into a dildo. They can't move, can't talk, and every vibration feels like an almost orgasm. Somewhere, distant laughter echoes… someone's having fun with this one.",

      "The toy trembles slightly, as if trying to protest.",
      "A faint buzz ripples through the air; maybe it's a scream, maybe it's just the batteries.",
      "The rubbery shape rolls a few inches, helplessly, before flopping back into silence.",
      "It gives the tiniest wiggle, but no sound follows—only the quiet hum of enchantment.",
      "The object rattles once, like it's trying to say something, but can't quite manage words."

After a flash of magic, their body collapses inward and reforms as duplicate of the forgotten adult toy. The original slowly fades away with a soft giggle. They can't move or speak, but you can definitely feel every every poke and prod from anyone who picks them up.",
